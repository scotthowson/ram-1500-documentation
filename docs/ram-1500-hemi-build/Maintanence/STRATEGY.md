# ðŸ§  Strategy Notes

- Prioritize **drivetrain, ignition, and fluids** for longevity.
- Front differential requires **75W-90 synthetic GL-5** (no LSD, no modifier).
- Rear differential requires **75W-140 synthetic GL-5** with LSD friction modifier included or added if shudder occurs.
- Transfer case fluid must be **ATF+4** spec (Red Line C+, Mopar ATF+4).
- When servicing transfer case or diffs, remove the fill plug first to ensure proper draining and filling.
- Use a quality fluid pump for refill unless using quarts with spout.
- Torque drain and fill plugs carefully to avoid thread damage (15-20 ft-lbs max).
- Replace all **spark plugs in one go** â€” 16 plugs is a big job but worth doing right.
- No tune planned? **Avoid lower-temp thermostats** (may trigger CEL).
- Plan for a **cooling system pressure test** if overheating signs appear.
- **Log everything here** â€” this record helps diagnose future issues and adds resale value.
