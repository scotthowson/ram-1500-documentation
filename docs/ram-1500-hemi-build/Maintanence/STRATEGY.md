# ðŸ§  Strategy Notes

## Mechanical & Maintenance Priorities

- Prioritize **drivetrain, ignition, and fluids** for maximum longevity and reliability.
- **Front differential:** Use **75W-90 synthetic GL-5** (no LSD additive or modifier).
- **Rear differential:** Use **75W-140 synthetic GL-5** with LSD friction modifier included or added if you experience shudder.
- **Transfer case fluid:** Must be **ATF+4 spec** (recommended: Red Line C+, Mopar ATF+4).
- When servicing transfer case or differentials, **remove the fill plug first** to ensure proper draining and filling.
- Use a quality fluid pump for refilling unless using fluid quarts with spouts for clean pouring.
- **Torque drain and fill plugs carefully** (max 15-20 ft-lbs) to avoid thread damage.
- Replace **all 16 spark plugs in one go** â€” itâ€™s a big job but worth doing right.
- No tune planned? **Avoid lower-temp thermostats** â€” they may trigger a Check Engine Light (CEL).
- Schedule a **cooling system pressure test** if you notice overheating or temperature irregularities.
- Follow **exact torque specs on critical fasteners** to prevent leaks, warping, or failures.
- Inspect cooling hoses, clamps, and radiator regularly for cracks or leaks.
- Replace ignition coils and plug wires proactively with spark plugs.
- Use **OEM or OEM-equivalent parts and fluids** on all critical systems.
- Maintain a detailed **maintenance log** including dates, mileage, parts used, and fluids â€” invaluable for future troubleshooting and resale.
- Calibrate your torque wrench annually to ensure accuracy.
- If towing or hauling heavily, consider upgrades like a bigger radiator, upgraded fans, or an aftermarket transmission cooler.
- Regularly check and maintain **tire pressures** including the spare.
- Lubricate chassis grease points (ball joints, tie rods, U-joints) on schedule.
- Inspect magnetic drain plugs for metal shavings to catch early bearing or gear wear.

## Cosmetic / Body Repair Plan

- Repair the **front bumper and bumper lip**:
  - Remove bumper and inspect damage fully.
  - Use quality automotive **body filler (Bondo or equivalent)** to fix cracks or dents.
  - Sand and prep surfaces thoroughly for paint adhesion.
  - Match factory paint color precisely:
    - Factory paint code for 2011 RAM 1500 Bright White is usually **PWJ** (verify exact code with your VIN).
    - Use OEM-quality Mopar paint or trusted automotive paint suppliers.
  - Apply primer, base coat, and clear coat for a professional finish.
  - Ideally, use a professional spray booth or a high-quality DIY setup â€” avoid cheap spray cans for durability and color fidelity.

## Tires & Wheels Recommendations

- Verify your **wheel size** before purchasing tires (typically 17" or 20" for your truck).
- Common stock tire sizes:
  - **265/70R17**
  - **265/60R20**
- Tire types based on use:
  - **All-Terrain (A/T)** tires (e.g., BFGoodrich KO2, Goodyear Wrangler Duratrac) for off-road or mixed use.
  - **Highway Terrain (H/T)** tires (e.g., Michelin Defender LTX M/S, Bridgestone Dueler H/L Alenza Plus) for mostly street driving.
- For towing/heavy load, ensure tires meet or exceed truckâ€™s **load index** and **speed rating**.
- Replace tires in sets or matched pairs for even wear and optimal handling.
- Check tire pressures regularly, including the spare tire.

## Final Notes

- Schedule cosmetic repairs after mechanical priorities are buttoned up to avoid damage to new paint.
- Coordinate tire replacement with suspension or brake service for convenience.
- Keep your maintenance log up to date â€” detailed records add serious value and peace of mind.

Feel free to ask if you want me to source exact paint codes, suggest tire models based on your driving style, or recommend local paint/body shops.  
No fluff, just what you need to keep your truck sharp, safe, and running strong.
