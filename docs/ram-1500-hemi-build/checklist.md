# Reliability & Performance Checklist

**Truck:** 2011 RAM 1500 5.7L HEMI
**Mileage:** \~161,000 km / \~100,000 mi

---

## ✅ Completed

* ✅ Synthetic oil change
* ✅ Installed cold air intake
* ✅ Replaced front wheel hubs + bearings

---

## 🟩 High Priority – Do Soon

* 🔧 Install **Mishimoto Catch Can**

  * [ ] Clean throttle body & intake while you're in there
  * [ ] (Optional) Add drain kit for easier service
* 🔄 Replace **PCV valve**
* 🔥 Replace **spark plugs** (NGK Iridium x16 — OEM interval 160k km)
* 🛢️ Change **front + rear diff fluid** (75W-90 full synthetic)
* 🛢️ Change **transfer case fluid**
* 🛢️ Check & flush **transmission fluid** (if never done)

---

## 🟨 Mid Priority – Inspect / Plan

* 🧵 Inspect **serpentine belt** & **tensioner**
* 🌡️ Coolant **flush/top-up** (use HOAT-spec coolant)
* 🧼 Clean **MAF sensor** *(if equipped — some HEMIs use MAP only)*

---

## 🟦 Optional / Performance Mods

* ❓ Install **180°F thermostat**

  > ⚠️ *Skip unless tuning — often causes P0128 CEL*
* 📏 Add **throttle body spacer** *(minor feel gain, no real power)*
* ❄️ Add **transmission cooler** *(recommended if towing/hauling)*

---

## 🛠️ Body & Exterior TODO

* [ ] Replace **front bumper**
* [ ] Replace **passenger fender**
* [ ] Replace or refinish **upper bumper lip**
* [ ] Perform **bodywork**, **bondo**, and **repair paint** where needed

---

## 🔧 Custom 3D Prints (Planned / In Progress)

* [ ] Brackets for catch can / hose routing
* [ ] Tow hook covers / grille pieces
* [ ] Custom sensor harness clips / protectors
* [ ] Organization tray for engine bay tools

---

## 🧠 Notes

* Prioritize drivetrain fluids and plugs next.
* Don’t bother with a 180°F stat unless you’re tuning.
* Once catch can + PCV is done, your intake will stay a lot cleaner.
